# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my **ongoing practice of Data Structures and Algorithms**
implemented in **C++**.

The primary focus of this repository is:
- Developing problem-solving skills
- Understanding algorithmic thinking
- Writing clean and efficient C++ solutions

This repository is built through **consistent practice** using structured
learning resources and problem-solving platforms.

## Purpose
- Strengthen DSA fundamentals
- Improve coding interview readiness
- Build long-term consistency in problem solving

## Notes
- This is an active learning repository
- Code is added progressively as concepts are learned
- Focus is on clarity and correctness over quantity
